- Add small area where text updates can be added ("saving image", "autosaving", etc)
	Probably would be best to have a queue system where any function can request a msg to be displayed 
	 and then the msg handler displays the next piece in the queue for like 1s and then gets rid of the msg 
- Add ability to display all PES taken that day (checkboxes)
- Add "Saved!" animation when using autostop
