- Add small area where text updates can be added ("saving image", "autosaving", etc)
	Probably would be best to have a queue system where any function can request a msg to be displayed 
	 and then the msg handler displays the next piece in the queue for like 1s and then gets rid of the msg 
- Add ability to display all PES taken that day (checkboxes)
- Add "Saved!" animation when using autostop 


- Instead of showing the file names or whatever, maybe have it so that whenever you're taking a scan, that tab has a little 
	icon in the corner (or something) to let you know a scan of that kind is being taken
