The collection of each data point in the action spectrum should be a single function 
	(i.e. consolidate each iteration of the for loop in start_action_scan() into one function)
	This fn would be broken down into:
		- Moving OPO and measuring wavelength 
		- Taking IR-SEVI image 
		- Running Melexir and calculating depletion 
		(Each of those would obviously be made up of smaller functions)
	This fn would ultimately be what I'd like to test with the vinoxide nu3 mode 

Initial test issues:
	Give the image number for each data point in .txt file
	Completion time is giving undefined for each value
	Excitation energy isn't getting saved
